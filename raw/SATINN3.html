            <p>The <b>data table</b> to the right is the primary output of this workflow. All other figures can be recreated using the input images, native segmentation (if applicable), and the data table. The preview only shows a small subset of the full table to reduce load times.</p>
            
            <p>The bottom figures are samples that can be recreated using the inputs and data table. You can use this to verify the accuracy of segmentation and classification. Only segmented objects can be classified. Tubules were initially filtered with a generic size and circularity exclusion filter. If tubules are missing or inaccurate, it is usually due to low quality microscopy images, incorrect segmentation parameters, or inappropriate filtering.</p>
