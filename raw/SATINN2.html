            <p>The <b>data table</b> to the right is the primary output of this workflow. All other figures can be recreated using the input images, native segmentation (if applicable), and the data table. The preview only shows a small subset of the full table to reduce load times.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can use the checkboxes to filter the table and figure outputs. <b>Intratubular</b> and <b>interstital</b> cells are defined as cells within/out of a segmented tubule. Note that a poor tubule segmentation can result in mislabeled cells.</li>
                <li><b>Randomize</b> reloads the table with random entries. Use this to sample large data tables (has no effect on figures).</li>
                <li><b>Save</b> will save the full data table, as *.csv or *.txt.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The bottom figures are examples of ways to present the data. You can use them to verify the accuracy of this workflow. Reminder: Only segmented objects can be classified. If cells are missing or inaccurate, it may be due to low quality microscopy images or incorrect segmentation parameters.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Segmentation image</b>. If a cell segmentation image was provided, this is that image. Otherwise, this is the output of native cell segmentation.</li>
                <li><b>Classification image</b>. Each cell class is color coded based on the legend (far right). Each color represents a cell with class of the highest confidence.</li>
                <li><b>Classification heatmap</b>. Distribution of class probabilites. If more than 300 cells are in the data table, it displays a random subset of 300 cells.</li>
                <li><b>Classification counts</b>. Bar plot of the total count of each classified cell type in the data table.</li>
                <li><b>Parameter: Area</b>. A boxchart of the distributions of cell areas, sorted by cell type.</li>
            </ul>
